<h2>Forensic Readiness</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/security-policy-framework" target="_blank">HMG Security Policy Framework</a> has this mandatory requirement:</p>
<blockquote>Departments and Agencies must put in place an appropriate range of technical controls for all ICT systems, proportionate to the value, importance and sensitivity of the information held and the requirements of any interconnected systems.</blockquote>
<p>The requirement means that the MOJ must:</p>
<blockquote>Have a forensic readiness policy that will maximise the ability to preserve and analyse data generated by an ICT system that may be required for legal and management purposes.</blockquote>
<p>The ICT Security Policy – Forensic Readiness Standard [link to follow] provides help on making an MOJ ICT system comply with the policy.</p>
<p>Note: Forensic readiness might affect handling of an IT security incident. Make sure you apply the IT Security - IT Incident Management Policy.</p>
<p>The policy statements are as follows:

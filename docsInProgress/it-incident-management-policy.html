<p>Good incident management enables the MOJ to respond to security incidents in a calm, efficient and effective manner. This incident management policy describes what must be done when an incident occurs.</p>
<p>The Incident Management Standard [link to follow] provides help with creating an incident management plan that complies with the policy. For example, the standard describes the roles and responsibilities of people working to address the incident.</p>
<p>The policy statements are as follows:
